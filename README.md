# MMGame

This is a windows forms .NET 6.0 application created in Visual Studio 2022. I'm pretty (â‰ˆ80%) sure that you would have to be on a Windows machine to run this but other than that if you have Visual Studio it should be a straight forward download the .zip and click the .sln in the folder & execute kind of thing. 

The instructions say I should "document my thought process and/or code structure, and describe any creative extensions attempted or implemented."

My thought process...

It's been quite a journey. First, I wanted to make sure that I could actually figure out and create the logic for a mastermind game in general so I did a windows console app. After I did that I decided to upgrade to more modern 2001 technology and do a windows form and I figured this would be my 'minimum viable product' because for me it's not a huge leap to go from console apps to windows forms but windows forms to MVP, for me, is difficult. I got the windows form created and looking... acceptable UI wise and then I was thinking it would be cool if I could send the interviews a link... You know what I'm going to try to host this thing on Heroku and then maybe connect it to MongoDB. So I spent a while trying to do that unsuccessfully, then I tried to host this on Azure which was not successful. Then thought maybe a more modern program like an MVC App would play nicer with Azure so I spent probably half or more of my time trying to make an MVC app and host it on Azure & Azure SQL. Lots of complete start overs probably partially out of frustration and I achieved various levels of completeness, but I don't know how much longer it would have taken me, longer than I have tonight for sure. I wish I had something better to show you all but this is just where I'm at right now, consider me inspired to do an MVC course on Udemy now.

I'm looking forward to talking to you all in a few days and I very much appreciate the opportunity.
