This is a windows forms application created in Visual Studio 2022. I'm pretty sure that you would have to be on a Windows machine to run this but other than that if you have a version of Visual Studio it should be straight forward.

I spent a lot of my time trying to get an MVC application version hosted on Azure & connected to Azure SQL but I wasn't able to do that succesfully prior to the deadline. I wish I had an MVC app to show you all but I made this first so I had a minimum viable product in the event that I couldn't finish my MVC app.
